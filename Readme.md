Twitter bot that generates a new riddle from the word hoard in the Anglo-Saxon poetic style every hour. 

Drawing on the riddles found in the Exeter Book, uses a Markov model with bigrams to generate novel sentences until 140 character limit is reached. Checks ensure unique tweets and that contain no full sentences from the original text.
